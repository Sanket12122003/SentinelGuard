# SentinelGuard  

**SentinelGuard** is a deepfake detection system designed to identify whether uploaded face images are real or fake, providing enhanced security for authentication systems. This project leverages **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to combat deepfake threats across industries like cybersecurity, defense, and digital identity verification.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Deepfake Detection:** Identifies real or fake faces with high accuracy.  
- **Authentication Support:** Enhances security for identity verification processes.   
- **Scalability:** Ready for future upgrades like voice and video analysis.  

---

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** PyTorch  
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 for GAN training

## **Installation**  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sentinelguard.git  
   cd sentinelguard

2.Set up a virtual environment:
   
     python -m venv env  
    source env/bin/activate # For Linux/Mac  
    env\Scripts\activate    # For Windows


3.Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. run the backend file:
   ```
   cd project
   python app.py

6. run the frontend file:
   ```
   cd project
   streamlit run frontend.py

## Usage
- Upload an image for deepfake detection.
- View results (Real or Fake) with a detailed analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend detection to videos and voice deepfakes.
- Improve scalability for larger datasets and faster processing.
- Develop a user-friendly mobile app for Android/iOS.
